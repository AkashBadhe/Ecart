# Getting Started & Installation

For getting started with the template you have to follow the below procedure. First navigate to the `root` directory. Then run below command for getting started with specific part.

```bash
# on root directory
yarn
```

<br>

## API (NestJs GraphQL)

1. Go to `/api/graphql` directory and run below command.

```bash
# on api/graphql directory
yarn
yarn start:dev
```

**NOTE** : This will start the server at `http://localhost:4000` for graphql api and you can access it from browser at `http://localhost:4000/graphql`(for graphql playground).

<br>

## API (NestJs REST)

1. Go to `/api/rest` directory and run below command.

```bash
# on api/rest directory
yarn
yarn start:dev
```

**NOTE** : This will start the server at `http://localhost:5000/api/` for rest api and you can access it from browser at `http://localhost:5000/docs`(for rest swagger doc).

<br>

## Admin(GraphQL)

For starting the admin dashboard part with corresponding api data run below commands.

1. Go to `/admin/graphql` folder.
2. Copy the contents of `.env.template` into a new file called `.env`
3. Run below command to start the server.

```bash
# on root directory
yarn dev:admin-gql
# or
# on admin/graphql directory
yarn dev

```

## Admin(REST)

For starting the admin dashboard part with corresponding api data run below commands.

1. Go to `/admin/rest` folder.
2. Copy the contents of `.env.template` into a new file called `.env`
3. Run below command to start the server.

```bash
# on root directory
yarn dev:admin-rest
# or
# on admin/rest directory
yarn dev

```

## Shop

For starting the shop part with corresponding api run below commands.

1. Go to `/shop` folder.
2. Copy the contents of `.env.template` into a new file called `.env`
3. Fill the `.env` file with your values like, `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=, SECRET=, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=`
4. SET `FRAMEWORK_PROVIDER='yourProjectType'` in `.env` file. ex: if you want to use rest then `FRAMEWORK_PROVIDER='rest'` or `FRAMEWORK_PROVIDER='graphql'`
5. SET `tsconfig.json`. if you want to use `rest version` then copy the content from `tsconfig.rest.json` to `tsconfig.json` file or if you want to use `graphql version` then copy the content from `tsconfig.graphql.json` to `tsconfig.json` file.
6. Run below command to start the server.

```bash
# on root directory

yarn dev:shop-gql
yarn dev:shop-rest

# or
# on shop directory
yarn dev:rest
yarn dev:gql

```

**NOTE** : API must be running for the above commands to work.

**NOTE** : `.env` file must be filled with your values.
## Only For Windows Users
```
- Go to your specific project root and find `.graphql-let.yml`
- Replace the env variable `${NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_API_ENDPOINT}` in schema field manually
- Provide your API url in the schema field.
- Also change the dev command at `package.json`
- Go to `shop/package.json` file and change the scripts:

"codegen": "node -r dotenv/config $(yarn bin)/graphql-let",
to
"codegen": "graphql-let",
```

# Folder Structure & Customization

`/admin` : In this portion all the admin dashboard related coding and functions.

`/shop` : All the shop related coding and functions.

`/api` : API related code for both graphql and rest.

<br>

# Configuration & Deployment

### API

- Navigate to `/api/{yourStack}`
- put your domain url in `src/common/constants.ts` file(if your stack is rest)
- Now host any where like any nodejs application.

## [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/)

If you want to host the template in vercel.com then follow the below command

### Admin and Shop

- After deploying the api you will get the api endpoint url. Put that url in the `/yourProject/yourStack/.env` ex: `/admin/graphql/.env`
- also need to put it within `vercel.json` .

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_API_ENDPOINT={put_your_api_url_here}/graphql;
NEXT_PUBLIC_REST_API_ENDPOINT={put_your_api_url_here}/api/;
```

- Now run below command(Within the project folder)

```bash
vercel
```

```
vercel
```

## NOTE: for deploying to `vercel` you need to install `vercel-cli` on your machine for more information please visit [here](https://vercel.com/docs/cli?query=cli#introduction/vercel-cli-reference)
